#1) i need a trie tree code with using mapping, first i need a file handle that will read the first word and store it it a string named word, and then it will read a second word from file and store it to the second string meaning, this is what the file handler code will do in first iteration, then it will send these two, word and meaning to trie tree and then it will store the string word character by character in trie tree and when the word will end, it will store the meaning of word in last node of word and then it will also set bool flag to true showing the word exist in the dictionary and also it will store the meaning in it as well, then again it will return to file handler code and take the other word and string from the file and agaiin store it in trie tree, it will keep doing that until the end of file, write code in c++ as well as c#, keep it simple\
